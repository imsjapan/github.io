			<h2>Abstract</h2>
			<p>The IMS OneRoster® (OR) standard addresses the exchange of student data (primarily about people, courses, enrollments and grades) between different educational systems for the specific needs of K-12. The primary use-cases are: the exchange of data between a Student Information System (SIS) and Learning Management System (LMS), and the rostering of learning tools [[OR-OVIEW-12]].</p>
			<p>The underlying OneRoster specification is available in:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>OR 1.2 Rostering Service Model [[ORROS-SM]] - to enable the exchange of information about the rostering of people in classes;</li>
				<li>OR 1.2 Resources Service Model [[ORRES-SM]] - to enable the exchange of information about the set of resources that SHOULD be made available to users, courses and classes;</li>
				<li>OR 1.2 Gradebook Service Model [[ORGBK-SM]] - to enable the exchange of information about results which may be aligned as lineItems and categories which are collections of lineItems.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The standard includes a REST-based binding to make it quicker and easier to implement the exchange of information about people, membership, courses and gradebooks. In addition to the REST binding description, a format for CSV file based exchange has also been defined: THIS DOCUMENT.</p>
			<p>CSV files are typically exchanged between the school and the vendor to populate the roster information needed to gain access to learning tools, portals and learning environments. This specification defines how the relevant information is to be stored in a set of CSV files. This set of CSV files is exchanged as a zip file (it also contains a 'manifest.csv' file that describes the associated data CSV files). This specificatiions DOES NOT define how the zip file is moved from system to system.</p>

				<h3>Scope and Context</h3>
				<p>This document contains the description of how the OneRoster data model is exchanged in a set of CSV files. This binding addresses the format and content of the CSV files: it does NOT define how the CSV files are exchanged between end systems. The other documents that should be used with this CSV binding are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>OneRoster 1.2 Implementation Guide [[!OR-IG]] - the best practices to be adopted when processing OneRoster CSV files;</li>
					<li>OneRoster 1.2 Conformance and Certification [[!OR-CC]] - the process by which an implementation can achieve OneRoster 1.2 CSV certification. </li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Changes Between OR 1.1 and 1.2</h3>
				<p>The differences between versions 1.1 and 1.2 of the OR specification CSV binding are:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The following editorial changes have been made:-
						<ul>
							<li>For the purposes of easing internationalization of this specification, all references to CEDS have been removed from the data model descriptions. Usage of the appropriate vocabularies are discussed in the Implementation Guide [[OR-IG]] and any appropriate profiling documents;</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following CSV files have been added:-
						<ul>
							<li>'userProfiles.csv'</li>
							<li>'roles.csv'</li>
							<li>'userResources.csv'</li>
							<li>'scoreScales.csv'</li>
							<li>'lineItemScoreScales.csv'</li>
							<li>'resultScoreScales.csv'</li>
							<li>'lineItemLearningObjectiveIds.csv'</li>
							<li>'resultLearningObjectiveIds.csv'</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following changes have been made to the 'manifest.csv' file:-
						<ul>
							<li>Rows for the eight new CSV files have been added</li>
							<li>The 'oneroster.version' row is required to have a value of '1.2' when referring to an OR 1.2 compliant manifest</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following changes have been made to the 'categories.csv' file:-
						<ul>
							<li>The 'weight' column has been added</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following changes have been made to the 'demographics.csv' file:-
						<ul>
							<li>The enumerated vocabulary for the 'sex' column is now permitted to have new values of 'other and 'unspecified'</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following changes have been made to the 'lineItems.csv' file:-
						<ul>
							<li>The 'schoolSourcedId' column has been added</li>
							<li>The 'gradingPeriodSourcedId' column has been renamed 'academicSessionSourcedId'</li>
							<li>The 'resultValueMin' and 'resultValueMax' attributes have been made optional</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following changes have been made to the 'results.csv' file:-
						<ul>
							<li>The 'classSourcedId', 'textScore', 'inProgress', 'incomplete', 'late' and 'missing' columns have been added</li>
							<li>Use of the 'score' column has been made OPTIONAL.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>The following changes have been made to the 'users.csv' file:-
						<ul>
							<li>The 'orgSourcedIds' column has been removed (org identification is now achieved via the 'roles.csv' file)</li>
							<li>The 'role' column has been removed (role allocation is now achieved via the 'roles.csv' file)</li>
							<li>The 'preferredGivenName', 'preferredMiddleName' and 'preferredFamilyName' columns have been added</li>
							<li>The 'primaryOrgSourcedId' column has been added</li>
							<li>The 'userMasterIdentifier' column has been added.</li>
							<li>The 'resourceSourcedIds' column has been added.</li>

			<section>
				<h3>Binding of the Data</h3>
				<p>Many districts currently provide student information to tool providers and LMS/LOR vendors as ‘.csv’ formatted files. For those districts that must continue to use CSV files to exchange roster information with vendors, the format defined in the Tables in Section 3 should be used: this format corresponds to the data models in the OneRoster 1.2 Rostering [[!ORROS-SM]], Resources [[!ORRES-SM]] and Gradebook [[!ORGBK-SM]] documents. Districts can choose to upload class rosters/gradebooks by preparing up to twenty (20) files in CSV format outlined in this document. The rosters/gradebooks could be available for both import and export. A summary of the set of files is given in Table 2.1.</p>

				<p>KEY:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>CSV File Name – the name of the CSV file;</li>
					<li>Required – denotes whether or not the CSV file MUST be supplied (Yes or No);</li>
					<li>Description – a statement of the content in the file;</li>
					<li>'*' denotes files added in the V1.2 release.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When data is exchanged there will be 1-22 CSV files. An exchange MUST include the 'manifest.csv' file. The case of when only the 'manifest.csv' is supplied is used to denote that no updates occurred. At most, 22 CSV files exchanged i.e. there MUST NOT be more than one of each of the data CSV files. When the set of files are for bulk processing they must be semantically consistent i.e. every object referenced in a file must also be defined in either the same, or one of the other files in the zip package (see Appendix A for more details on this set of file dependencies).</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Exchanging the CSV Files</h3>
				<p>For V1.2 the CSV files will be exchanged as a zip file.  The encompassed files must be at the root level i.e. they MUST NOT be contained within an enclosing directory. There is NO constraint on the name of the zip file but it must have a file extension of ‘zip’. The compression MUST conform to [[!RFC1951]].</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Compatibility Between V1.0, V1.1 and V1.2</h3>
				<p>A system that imports both V1.0, V1.1 and V1.2 compliant data sets must differentiate using the following algorithm:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>If a 'manifest.csv' file is present then the data set conforms to V1.1 and/or V1.2 (this must be assumed even if the rest of the file set conforms to OneRoster 1.0 definitions and the appropriate error messages must be produced but the subsequent processing is implementation dependent). The manifest file contains the list of CSV files that MUST also accompany the manifest file. If the set of supplied files differs from the list of files in the manifest then an import error should be reported and the system is permitted to process the data as defined by the implementation;</li>
					<li>If a 'manifest.csv' file is NOT present then, under normal operations, the data set conforms to V1.0. Seven data files MUST be supplied i.e. one file for each of the data models (there MUST NOT be any of the new CSV data files introduced in V1.1/V1.2).  If a file is missing then an error should be reported and the system is permitted to process the data as defined by the implementation. In the case where the 'manifest.csv' file is missing but the file set conforms to OneRoster 1.1/1.2 then the appropriate error message should be produced and the subsequent processing is implementation dependent.</li>
				</ul>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3> Bulk/Delta Behavior Constraints</h3>
				<p>The existence and management of a record is controlled via the bulk and delta processing options. A record can be in four possible states:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>'No Record' – the record has not been created or it did exist but the system has deleted the record and it cannot be recovered with the previously assigned sourcedId;</li>
					<li>'Record[-]' – the record has been created and assigned a sourcedId but it has not yet been activated;</li>
					<li>'Record[Active]' – the record status has been set to 'active';</li>
					<li>'Record[ToBeDeleted]' – the record status has been set of 'tobedeleted'.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>For each state there are four possible types of transition events:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>B[-] – a bulk transfer has occurred and an existing record (one with a sourcedId) does not appear in those files;</li>
					<li>B[S] – a bulk transfer has occurred and the record occurs in the new file set;</li>
					<li>D[A] – a delta transfer has occurred and the record status is set as 'active';</li>
					<li>D[D] – a delta transfer has occurred and the record status is set as 'tobedeleted'.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>The 'System Deletes the Record' transition is only possible when the record is in the state of 'Record[ToBeDeleted]'. For this transition the system deletes the record (the length of time between this deletion action and the record being set as 'tobedeleted' is implementation dependent).</p>
				<p>The state diagram for the creation and management of a record in a service provider is shown in Figure 1.</p>
				
				<figure>

					<figcaption>– State diagram for the management of records using bulk/delta processing at the service provider.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>A OneRoster Service Consumer could issue a 'HTTP GET' request for the record in each of these four states. When such a read request is made the request will result in the following payloads:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>'No Record' – in the case of a single record request a 404 response will be returned;</li>
					<li>'Record[-]' – the record will be returned with an empty 'status' field and an empty 'dateLastModified' field;</li>
					<li>'Record[Active]' – the record will be returned with a 'status' field value of 'active' and the 'dateLastModified' field set to the time the record was last changed;</li>
					<li>'Record[ToBeDeleted]' – the record will be returned with a 'status' field value of 'tobedeleted' and the 'dateLastModified' field set to the time the record was last changed.</li>

<!-- ================================================================================================== -->
		
<!-- CSV Format -->
		
		<section>
			<h2>CSV Format</h2>
			<p>This Section is NORMATIVE.</p>
			<p>The file format for each of the data files is a Comma Separated Values (CSV) format as specified in [[!RFC4180]] with the extra restriction that carriage-returns are not permitted within a field. Fields containing commas and double-quotes must be enclosed in double-quotes. If double-quotes are used to enclose a field, then a double-quote appearing inside the field must be escaped by preceding it with another double-quote.</p>
			<p>The CSV files must be UTF-8 encoded [[!RFC3629]]. Importing processors must tolerate BOM (Byte Order Mark) prefixes and ignore them. In a UTF-8 encoded file with a BOM, the BOM will appear as the 3-byte sequence ‘EF BB BF’ at the beginning of the file. If present, the CSV header will begin at the 4th byte of the file; if not present, the CSV header will begin at the 1st byte of the file.</p>
			<p>Other key points are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All header names and content values within the CSV file are case-sensitive. Incorrect case will result in conformance failure and should be logged as a detected error;</li>
				<li>The Header row for each file is required;</li>
				<li>The Header fields for a file must be supplied in the same order as defined in the tables below. If metadata extension fields are used, then they must be added to the right of the defined data fields in the specification, as the last set of columns. This ensures that the sequence of the defined data fields remains fixed irrespective of the presence or not of metadata fields;</li>
				<li>Header field names must be uniquely named within a file;</li>
				<li>Files that contain no data rows are NOT permitted;</li>
				<li>For ALL fields that are optional and which have a defined enumeration token set, then the value of NULL/blank (i.e. a blank value "") is permitted to denote that NO data is supplied;</li>
				<li>The support of ALL string-based data-types requires that a maximum length of at least 255 must be supported by implementations. If string lengths of greater than 255 are used then system may lose some part of the string without failing conformance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When mapping from the data model [[!ORROS-SM]], [[!ORRES-SM]], [[!ORGBK-SM]] to the equivalent column headers the following special rules have been applied:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When referencing an object in the data model (using the data-type GUIDRef) the name has been extended using SourcedId e.g. 'org' to 'orgSourcedId';</li>
				<li>When referring to a set of objects in the data model maps to a comma separated list, enclosed in quotation marks, under the corresponding column header (as per [[!RFC4180]]);</li>
				<li>The references to resources in the Class and Course data models have NOT been mapped (instead the two CSV files 'classResources.csv' and 'courseResources.csv' are used).</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>CSV import/export is envisaged to work in one of two ways, bulk and delta:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>In BULK processing, the CSV files MUST NOT contain values in the "dateLastModified" and "status" fields. That is to say, for each row, there will be no data for either of these fields. Importing Systems MUST view this incoming data as the reference version of all data. That is to say, if records that were previously imported do not appear in this bulk csv file, then the importing system should internally mark those records as 'tobedeleted' with the 'dateLastModified' value set to the time of the bulk files import processing. If said records subsequently appear in a future bulk file, then those records should be updated and made active. When a set of Bulk files are created they must be semantically complete i.e. every object referenced by another object MUST also be defined in the corresponding source CSV file and included with the 'manifest.csv' file;</li>
				<li>In DELTA processing, the incoming CSV file MUST contain values in the "dateLastModified" and "status" fields. That is to say, each row in the CSV file should include data describing that (the row) data was last modified and its status. Importing systems must view this incoming delta file as changes to the reference data, and should make the appropriate changes, deletions and insertions of the new data.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>The key to the CSV description tables listed in Subsections 3.2 to 3.20 is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Field Header – the name for the Column Header;</li>
				<li>Required – denotes if data must be present. The meanings for this field are:-
					<ul>
						<li>'Yes' for fields which are always required</li>
						<li>'Yes for Delta' for fields which must be populated for Delta processing, and which must be blank for Bulk processing</li>
						<li>'No' for fields which do not require to have values;</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Format – the data-type for the data:-
					<ul>
						<li>'GUID' denotes some form of globally unique identifier (this must be less than 256 characters). This is not restricted to the 128 bit UUID format but MUST contain ONLY the characters '0-1 | a-Z | A-Z | . | - | _ | / | @' (the '|' character is being used as a separator in the expression)</li>
						<li>'GUID Reference' denotes the GUID of an object defined in some other CSV data file (this is limited to the same set of characters as per a 'GUID')</li>
						<li>'UUID Reference' denotes the UUID of the referenced object (this must be a valid 128 bit UUID)</li>
						<li>'List of GUID Reference' denotes a comma-delimited list of GUID References of objects defined in another CSV data file </li>
						<li>'ID' denotes an identifier defined outside of the OneRoster specification, e.g. identifiers generated by vendors for their resources in the Resources dataset</li>
						<li>'String' denotes a sequence of characters that should follow the description. Generally this is aimed to be human-readable e.g. "Science Lesson"</li>
						<li>'List of Strings' denotes a sequence of Strings. The individual strings within the list must not contain commas, and the list is a comma separated list e.g.  "1,2,3". If a List of Strings contains more than one element, then it must be double-quote encapsulated</li>
						<li>'Enumeration' denotes a fixed set of values that will be referred to in the description. In the case of fields which are not required, an empty field denotes no value</li>
						<li>'Enumeration List' denotes a list of Enumerations. The list is comma separated e.g. "teacher,student,aide"</li>
						<li>'Float' denotes a floating point number</li>
						<li>'DateTime' denotes a timestamp format. DateTimes MUST be expressed in W3C profile of ISO 8601 [[!ISO8601]] and MUST contain the UTC timezone e.g. "2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z" </li>
						<li>'Date' denotes a date format. Dates MUST be expressed using ISO 8601 format [[!ISO8601]], more commonly formatted as "YYYY-MM-DD" e.g. "2002-04-23"</li>
						<li>'Year' denotes a date format of year only. Years MUST be expressed using ISO 8601 format [[!ISO8601]], more commonly formatted as "YYYY" e.g. "2002";</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Example/Description – an example of the expected data, and a brief statement of the nature of the content.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Extending &amp; Profiling the CSV Binding</h2>
			<p>This Section is NON-NORMATIVE.</p>
			<section>
				<h3>Extending the CSV Binding</h3>
				<section>
					<h4>Proprietary Data Elements</h4>
					<p>It is recognized that implementers may wish to extend the specification. The preferred mechanism for doing this is for implementers to use an extension 
						space within the OneRoster data model, and then set their CSV parsers to read those extension attributes. Extensions are ONLY permitted by adding 'metadata' 
						named columns to the end of the set of columns already defined in the specification.</p>
					<p>An example of creating such an extension is given in the accompanying Implementation Guide document [[!OR-IG]].</p>
				</section>
				
				<section>
					<h4>Proprietary Vocabulary Terms</h4>
					<p>In this version the ability to extend some of the enumerated vocabularies has been added: currently, ONLY the 'classType' (classes.csv), 'role' (enrollments.csv 
						and roles.csv), 'roles' (resources.csv), 'scoreStatus' (results.csv), 'SessionTypeEnum', 'sex' (demographics.csv), 'source' (lineItemLearningObjectiveIds.csv and resultLearningObjectiveIds.csv) 
						and 'type' (academicSession.csv and orgs.csv) vocabularies MAY be extended. Each proprietary term must start with the characters 'ext:'.</p>
					<p>An example of creating such an extension is given in the accompanying Implementation Guide document [[!OR-IG]].</p>
				</section>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h3>Profiling the CSV Binding</h3>
				<p>This Service can be profiled. In general, Profiling is used to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Refine which Interfaces are used and which operations are supported for each Interface;</li>
					<li>Refine the data models by increasing the constraints on the base definitions.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Valid Profiles must be restrictive i.e. optional features can be removed or constraints increased but new features must not be added. A Profile of this 
					service is made by annotating the UML supplied with the documentation for the specification.</p>
				<p>It is strongly recommended that a profile of this specification is undertaken either by, or with the close support, of IMS Global. However, no matter 
					who is responsible for creating the profile artefacts (documents, OpenAPI files, XSDs, etc.), it is strongly recommended that the IMS specification tools 
					are used. This will ensure that the artefacts are consistent with the base specifications and that useful support documentation is automatically produced 
					e.g. creation of a document that summarises the differences between the base specification and the profile. Organizations wishing to produce a profile of 
					this specification should contact Lisa Mattson (IMS Global Chief Operations Officer) at: <a href="mailto:lmattson@imsglobal.org">lmattson@imsglobal.org.</a></p>

			<p>This Section is NON-NORMATIVE.</p>
			<p>Table A1 is the dependency matrix for the CSV files. This shows the set of CSV files that MUST be supplied for BULK exchange; this dependency is created because the set of supplied CSV files must be semantically complete and the data model defines certain fields must be present within a CSV file.  To read the matrix select the CSV file of interest in the left hand column. The entries along that row indicate if some other CSV file is required (R) or may be required (O) if an associated optional field has been included in the source CSV file.</p>
			<p>The color coding for Table A1 is:-</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Green - denotes a source file that has NO dependencies on the other CSV files (the manifest will include a single data file i.e. either 'categories.csv' or 'resources.csv')</li>
				<li>Yellow - denotes a source file that has a dependency only on itself i.e. another row in the same CSV file (the manifest will include a single data file i.e. of either 'academicSessions.csv' or 'orgs.csv')</li>
				<li>Orange - denotes a source file that has a dependency on some other file that itself is self contained i.e. a CSV file that is color-coded Green or Yellow. 'courses.csv' has a dependency on the Yellow and/or Green coded files</li>
				<li>Pink - denotes a source file that a dependency on some other file that itself has other dependencies. Pink coded files are 'classes.csv', 'classResources.csv', 'courseResources.csv', 'demographics.csv', 'roles.csv', 'userProfiles.csv' and 'users.csv'</li>
				<li>Red - denotes a source file that as a further depth of dependency when compared to the files that are color coded Pink. Red coded files are 'enrollments.csv', 'lineItems.csv', 'lineItemScoreScales.csv', 'results.csv', 'resultScoreScales.csv', and 'scoreScales.csv'.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>The key conclusions are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No CSV file is dependent on the 'classResoures.csv', 'courseResources.csv', 'demographics.csv', 'enrollments.csv', 'lineItemScoreScales.csv', 'results.csv', 'resultScoreScales.csv', 'lineItemLearningObjectiveIds.csv', 'resultLearningObjectiveIds.csv' and 'userResources.csv'files</li>
				<li>The Gradebooks-oriented CSV file-set ('categories.csv', 'lineItems.csv', 'results.csv', 'lineItemLearningObjectiveIds.csv', 'resultLearningObjectiveIds.csv', 'scoreScales.csv', 'lineItemScoreScales.csv' and 'resultScoreScales.csv' files) IS dependent on several of the Rostering CSV files</li>
				<li>The Rostering-oriented CSV file-set must consist of 'academicsessions.csv', 'classes.csv', 'courses.csv', 'enrollments.csv', 'orgs.csv', 'roles.csv' and 'users.csv'.</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>NOTE: An implementation may impose further constraints on the set of files required for semantic consistency i.e. more files may need to be supplied than the strict minimum.</p>
